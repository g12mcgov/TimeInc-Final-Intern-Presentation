# TimeInc-Final-Intern-Presentation

My final presentation for the Time Life Alumni Society website.

Overview
=======

Currently, this is a [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) presentation, and can be viewed publicly through Github pages [here](http://g12mcgov.github.io/TimeInc-Final-Intern-Presentation).

This simply highlights my building of the Time & Life Alumni Society web app, the DAM GUI backend, and some takeaways from my summer internship here at Time Inc.
